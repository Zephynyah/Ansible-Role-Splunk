# Splunk CA Role

This Ansible role is designed to manage the creation and deployment of SSL certificates for Splunk instances. It includes tasks for generating a Root CA, signing server certificates, and deploying them to Splunk instances to enable secure communication.

## Features

- Generate a Root CA (Certificate Authority).
- Create private keys and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for Splunk instances.
- Sign server certificates using the Root CA.
- Deploy SSL certificates and private keys to Splunk instances.
- Configure Splunk to use SSL for secure communication.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.3 or later.
- The `community.crypto` collection for OpenSSL-related tasks. From the playbook's **root** directory, install it using:
  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy collection install tar/community-crypto-2.26.0.tar.gz -p collections/
  ```

**Tips:** 

1. The `splunkca_directory` must be loacted on the **ansible controller** wher **ansible** is installed.
2. the `splunk_webcert_dir` is on the sever: `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/webcerts`

## Playbook
The following example playbooks have been included in this project for your reference:

- **splunkca_generate_ownca.yml** - Generate the CA for the Splunk hosts using the `generate_ownca.yml` task in the splunkca role. 
- **splunkca_generate_server_certs.yml** - Generates the server certificates for each Splunk Enterprise instances in the `full` section of the inventory using the `generate_server_certificates.yml` task in the splunkca role.
- **splunkca_deploy_server_certs.yml** - Deploys server certificates and configures each Splunk Enterprise instances in the `full` section of the inventory using the `deploy_server_certificates.yml` task in the splunkca role. See [Configure Splunk for SSL](#Configure-Splunk-for-SSL)


## Example Playbook

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use this role in a playbook:

```yaml
- name: Configure SSL for Splunk Instances
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    splunkca_directory: "/etc/splunk/ca"
    splunkca_passphrase: "your_secure_passphrase"
    splunkca_privatekey: "ca.key"
    splunkca_certificate: "ca.pem"
    splunk_cert_dir: "custom_certs"
    splunk_home: "/opt/splunk"
    splunk_http_port: 8000
  roles:
    - splunk_ca
```

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Validate Parameters
Ensures all required variables are defined and valid.

### 2. Generate Root CA
Creates a Root CA private key and self-signed certificate. Default Path: `/etc/splunk/ca`

### 3. Generate Server Certificates
Creates private keys and CSRs for Splunk instances and signs them using the Root CA. Default Path: `/etc/splunk/certs`

### 4. Deploy Certificates
Copies the signed certificates and private keys to the appropriate directories on Splunk instances. `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/webcerts`

### 5. Configure Splunk for SSL
Updates Splunk configuration files (e.g., `web.conf`) to enable SSL.

```
[settings]
... 
enableSplunkWebSSL = 1
httpport = 8443
serverCert = etc/auth/webcerts/<hostname>.server.pem
privKeyPath = etc/auth/webcerts/<hostname>.server.key
```

## Dependencies

This role depends on the `community.crypto` collection for OpenSSL-related tasks. From the playbook's **root** directory, install it using:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install tar/community-crypto-2.26.0.tar.gz -p collections/
```
